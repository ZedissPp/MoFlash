Usability:

Move MoFlash.sh to the storage/downloads directory.

Then copy and paste the commands below into Termux:

termux-setup-storage

cd storage/downloads

mv MoFlash.sh $HOME

cd $HOME

chmod +x MoFlash.sh

Finally, run the tool with the following command:

./MoFlash.sh

⚠️ Important Notice

The tool flashes both A/B slots, but even so,
be very careful when deciding to lock the bootloader.
If the phone becomes unusable, the decision was entirely yours.
